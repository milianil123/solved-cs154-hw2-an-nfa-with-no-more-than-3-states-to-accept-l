Given L = {a<sup>n</sup>b : n ≥ 0} over Σ = {a, b}.

Design an NFA with no more than 3 states to accept L’ where L’ = L (L ⋃ {λ})

<ol>

 <li>Solve the problem using the provided JFLAP in the Canvas</li>

 <li>Save it as: First_Name.Last_Name.<strong>List_Num</strong>.jff</li>

</ol>

If your first or last name has more than one part, <strong>hyphenate</strong> them and  don’t use underscore. (e.g.: ahmad.yazdan-khah.1.jff)

Also note that <strong>my fake</strong> <strong>list number</strong> is written as ‘1’, not ’01’.
